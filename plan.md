## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Steps 1-4)
- Core infrastructure setup
- Configuration and logging
- Basic MCP server setup
- Replicated API client foundation

**Parallel Opportunities:**
- After Step 1: Steps 2 and 4 can run in parallel
- Step 3 must wait for Step 2 to complete

### Phase 2: Core API Integration (Steps 5-8)
- Implement Replicated API client
- Add data models
- Create MCP tool handlers
- Implement rate limiting

**Parallel Opportunities:**
- Step 7 can start handler structure while Step 5 is in progress
- After Step 5: Steps 6 and 8 can run in parallel
- Step 7 can be completed incrementally as APIs are implemented

### Phase 3: Feature Complete (Steps 9-12)
- Complete all read-only operations
- Add comprehensive error handling
- Integration testing
- Documentation and polish

**Parallel Opportunities:**
- Steps 9, 10, and 11 can largely run in parallel
- Step 12 must wait for all others to complete

## Parallel Implementation Strategy

### Sprint 1: Foundation (Estimated: 4-6 days)
```
Day 1-2: Step 1 (Configuration & Logging) - SEQUENTIAL
Day 3-4: Step 2 (Data Models) + Step 4 (MCP Server) - PARALLEL
Day 5-6: Step 3 (HTTP Client) - SEQUENTIAL (waits for Step 2)
```

### Sprint 2: Core Integration (Estimated: 6-9 days)
```
Day 1-3: Step 5 (Application API) + Step 7 (Handler Structure) - PARALLEL
Day 4-7: Step 6 (Other APIs) + Step 8 (Rate Limiting) - PARALLEL
Day 8-9: Step 7 (Complete Handlers) + Step 9 (Start Testing) - PARALLEL
```

### Sprint 3: Feature Complete (Estimated: 5-7 days)
```
Day 1-5: Step 9 (Testing) + Step 10 (Documentation) + Step 11 (CI/CD) - PARALLEL
Day 6-7: Step 12 (Final Integration) - SEQUENTIAL
```

**Total Parallel Timeline**: 15-22 days (vs 25-38 days sequential)

## Parallel Development Coordination

### Team Coordination Requirements

**For Parallel Development Success:**
- **Clear Interface Definitions**: Establish Go interfaces and struct definitions early
- **Regular Integration Checkpoints**: Daily standup to coordinate parallel work
- **Shared Coding Standards**: Consistent patterns across all parallel work streams
- **Integration Testing**: Continuous integration of parallel work streams
- **Communication Channels**: Dedicated channels for each parallel work stream

### GitHub Issue Labels for Coordination

- `can-parallelize`: Issues that can run simultaneously with others
- `can-start-early`: Issues that can begin before dependencies fully complete
- `enables-parallel`: Issues that unlock parallel work when completed
- `phase-1`, `phase-2`, `phase-3`: Development phase organization

### Critical Path Dependencies

**Must Complete Sequentially:**
1. Step 1 → Everything else (foundation requirement)
2. Step 2 → Step 3 (HTTP client needs data models)
3. Step 5 → Step 6 (other APIs follow application patterns)
4. Steps 1-11 → Step 12 (final integration requires everything)

**Can Overlap/Parallelize:**
- Steps 2 & 4 (after Step 1)
- Steps 6 & 8 (after Step 5)
- Steps 9, 10 & 11 (after core functionality)
